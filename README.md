# Bluejay

Bluejay is a task-reward system designed for teachers and students. Student motivation is 
crucial to learning, and Bluejay allows teachers to provide small, motivating incentives 
in the form of rewards for everyday classroom tasks. Our goal is to allow teachers to 
motivate students of all ability levels to keep trying their best.
